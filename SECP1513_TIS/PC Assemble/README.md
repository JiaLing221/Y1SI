## 📜 Reflection
As someone pursuing a Computer Science degree with a focus on Data Engineering, this experience was particularly meaningful. While much of my academic work revolves around abstract software concepts, assembling a PC grounded me in the tangible aspects of computing. It deepened my understanding of the hardware that supports the data systems and algorithms I work with.

The experience also reminded me of the importance of precision. Even a minor misstep, such as improperly seating RAM or connecting the wrong cables, can lead to significant issues. This parallels my work in data engineering, where attention to detail is equally critical.
