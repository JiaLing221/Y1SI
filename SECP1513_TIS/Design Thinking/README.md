## 📜 Reflection
As a Computer Science student, Design Thinking feels particularly relevant. While my field is often data-driven and technical, the principles of Design Thinking remind me to consider the human side of the solutions I create. For instance, when designing a data pipeline or visualization, understanding how users interact with and interpret the data is critical.

The process also encouraged me to embrace a mindset of curiosity and experimentation. I realized that the fear of failure can stifle innovation, but Design Thinking reframes failure as an opportunity to learn and improve.
