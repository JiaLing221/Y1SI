## 📜 Reflection
Visiting UTM Digital was an enlightening experience that offered a deeper appreciation of how digital transformation can enhance education and research. The visit underscored the importance of integrating technology into academic and operational frameworks to foster innovation and improve accessibility.

As a Computer Science student focusing on Data Engineering, the visit was particularly inspiring. Seeing practical implementations of data-driven technologies reinforced my passion for pursuing a career in this field. It also broadened my understanding of how data engineering can have real-world applications beyond theoretical concepts.

Moving forward, I aim to apply some of the insights gained during this visit to my academic projects. Whether it's designing more efficient data pipelines or focusing on user-centered data visualization, the principles observed at UTM Digital will serve as a guiding framework. Additionally, I plan to explore internship or collaboration opportunities with UTM Digital to deepen my practical knowledge and skills.
